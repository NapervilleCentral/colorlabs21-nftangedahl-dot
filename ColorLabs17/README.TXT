Input: Anthony: Colors look good but the image looks flat (try1)
Input: Chris: Colors are good but the image looks muddy and dark (try2)
Input: Ryan: Colors look better but still blend together (try3)

For this lab I tried to refine my image multiple times based on what my classmates said. In my first try I used a different color palette, but some people say that the colors were flat, so I switched to a bolder color palette and adjusted some things. Then I was told that some areas looked muddy so for my third try I increased the brightness and contrast to help separate the shadows. The improved the visibility of my facial features. I then refined my palette one more time in my final try and adjusted some intensity scaling to make a cleaner and clear image.
